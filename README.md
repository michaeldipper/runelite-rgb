# RGB Plugin
An RGB plugin for RuneLite

The goal of this plugin is to use some info from RuneLite to customise lighting for various peripherals. For example,
changing lights to green when poisoned, or dark green when envenomed.

The MVP will integrate with SteelSeries Hub (since I have a Rival 600), probably by sending JSON.

Ideas:
* Lighting based on player status e.g. poison, health, frozen
* Lighting zones to denote percentages e.g. HP%, prayer%
* Ambient lighting from the screen-space
